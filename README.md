### Github Repositories Website
This project is a GitHub Repositories Explorer that allows users to browse repositories from a specific GitHub organization. It fetches data from GitHub's API and displays a  repository listing, with the ability to search through them. You can also view more detailed information for each repository, such as:
    Repository name
    Description
    Number of forks, open issues, and watchers
    Primary language
    Link to the repository on GitHub

### Features:
List Repositories: Displays a list of repositories fetched from the GitHub API.
Search Repositories: A search bar allows users to filter repositories by name.
View Repository Details: Clicking on a repository provides more detailed information like forks, watchers, issues, and language.
Responsive Design: Built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring the app works across all device sizes.
Code-Splitting: Pages are lazy-loaded to optimize performance, resulting in faster loading times.
Error Handling: Gracefully handles and displays errors if API calls fail.


### Technologies Used:
The following technologies were used to build this project:

React: The core library for building user interfaces with a component-based structure.
CSS: For responsive styling and layout of the components.
Native Fetch API: For making HTTP requests to communicate with the GitHub API.
React Router: To manage navigation between the home page and the repository details page.
PropTypes: For prop validation, ensuring the components receive the correct data types.
Lazy Loading: Implemented for dynamic imports to ensure that components are loaded only when needed, improving performance.

### Why These Libraries?
React was chosen for its flexibility and ease of creating reusable UI components.
Native Fetch API was chosen for simplicity, as it is built-in to modern browsers and provides a lightweight way to handle HTTP requests.
React Router allows for seamless navigation without full-page reloads.
PropTypes helps with prop validation, making the app more robust by ensuring components receive the expected data.

### Installation and Running the Project
Prerequisites:
You need Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.
A GitHub account for accessing the GitHub API.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Clone the Repository:
    Step 1: Clone the Repository
    Open your terminal (or command prompt).
    Run the following command to clone the repository from GitHub:
    git clone https://github.com/bhawneetkaur13/github_repos_website.git

2. Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
    After the repository is cloned, navigate to the project folder by using the cd command:
    cd github_repos_website

3. Step 3: Install Dependencies
    Run the following command to install all the required dependencies:
    npm install

4. Step 4: Set up Environment Variables
    1. In the root of your project, create a .env file by running:
       touch .env
    2. Open the .env file and add the following line:
        REACT_APP_GITHUB_API=https://api.github.com/orgs/godaddy/repos

5. Step 5: Run the App
    Run the following command to start the development server:
    npm start

6. Step 6: Run Tests
    To ensure everything is working correctly, you can run the tests by executing:
    npm test


### Time Constraints and Omissions:
While the current version of the project provides core functionality, there are some features that could be added in future iterations:

Pagination: If the number of repositories is large, implementing pagination would improve the user experience.
Advanced Search: Expanding the search functionality to filter repositories by language, forks, or watchers would give users more control over their search.
